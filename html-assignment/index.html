    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is <em>Rodion Varlamov</em>. Currently, I am studying in the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program. Before entering this program, I studied in a program called Computer Engineering Technology, but eventually, I found out that it was not my cup of tea.
<br>Regarding my hobbies. I love cars, especially brands such as <abbr title="Bayerische Motoren Werke">BMW</abbr> and Toyota. I received my driver's license when I turned 18 years old. I was indecisive about what car I should buy as my first car. After a while, I decided to get a Toyota Sprinter Marino with a manual transmission.</p>
